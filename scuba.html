  <h1 style="color: white">Lankayan Island</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Location:</strong> Sandakan, Sabah, Malaysia.<br>
    A small island located north of the city of Sandakan in eastern Sabah. Lankayan only has one (luxurious) resort and it’s all about <br>
    diving and relaxing. The island is known for its wrecks, macro diving, and whale shark sightings from the months of March to May. <br>
    After Sipadan, Lankayan probably offers the best dive spots and diving conditions in Malaysia.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Best time to dive:</strong> Lankayan Island is an all-year diving destination, but between the months of March and May you <br>
    have a chance to dive with the mythical whale sharks.<br>
    <strong>Ideal for:</strong> Experienced divers.<br>
    <strong>How to get there:</strong> There is only one resort on Lankayan Island that is accessible by boat. To get there, you need to <br>
    arrive in Sandakan (which does have an airport) and take the boat across. This journey takes approximately two hours.<br>

   <h1 style="color: white">Tioman Island</h1>
   <p>
     <strong>Location:</strong> Pahang, Malaysia.<br>
     Diving conditions at Tioman are similar to the other popular islands nearby. The island is part of the Mersing Marine Park and <br>
     by white coral reefs, making it a popular scuba diving destination. Another fascination with Tioman is the tale of a beautiful <br>
     dragon princess associated with the island. Legend has it that a dragon princess, on a journey to Singapore, stopped to seek solace<br>
     in the crystal-clear water of the South China Sea. Enchanted by the charms of the place, she decided to discontinue her trip. The <br>
     princess took the form of an island and pledged to offer shelter and comfort to passing travellers.<br>
     <br>
     <strong>Best time to dive:</strong> February to November.<br>
     <strong>Ideal for:</strong> Experienced and beginner scuba divers.<br>
     <strong>How to get there:</strong> There are a few different ways to get to Tioman Island, depending on where you’re coming from.<br>
     The most common way is to take the ferry from Mersing on the mainland. The ferry service is operated by Bluewater Express and runs<br>
     2-3 times per day. The trip takes two hours and stops at several places along the Tioman coast. There are also speedboat options, <br>
     although they are not usually very reliable.<br>

    <h1 style="color: white">Perhentian Island</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Location:</strong> Terengganu, Malaysia.<br>
      The Perhentian Islands are a small group of islands surrounded by coral reefs. There are two main islands here: Palau Perhentian Besar,<br>
      which caters to family and luxury travel, and Palau Perhentian Kecil, which is known for its more budget-friendly accommodations. Perhentian<br>
      is the best island in Malaysia to do a diving course. The diving conditions are splendid for beginners, and there are many dive spots available<br>
      to enjoy immediately after finishing a PADI course. If you are a beginner, Perhentian Island is definitely the place to be.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Best time to dive:</strong> April to December.<br>
      <strong>Ideal for:</strong> Scuba Diving beginners.<br>
      <strong>How to get there:</strong> There is no airport on any of the Perhentian Islands, so the only way to access it is by boat. A ferry runs from <br>
      Kuala Besut, which is a small town known as the gateway to the Perhentian Islands and there are also reliable licenced speedboats from Kuala Besut.<br>
