  <h1 style="color: white">Mount Takun</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Location:</strong> Templer Park, 48200 Rawang, Selangor.<br>
    <strong>Attractions:</strong> Bukit Takun is a large limestone outcrop over a solid granite base, with dense jungle and a golf course <br>
    in the vicinity; thereby making for a scenic location to enjoy rock climbing in Malaysia. It is also one of the largest climbing areas <br>
    in the Klang Valley and has over 120 pitches and 80 different routes. The cliff is 300 meters in height, and currently, all of the courses <br>
    are situated at the east face, and most of them are bolted. Frequent travellers on this route strongly urge on getting your name registered <br>
    with the guard, to avoid further trouble.<br>

  <h1 style="color: white">Mount Keteri</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Location:</strong> Bukit Keteri, 02500 Kangar, Perlis.<br>
    <strong>Attractions:</strong> Bukit Keteri is a small village located in Perlis in northern Malaysia. The region is <br>
    well-known for its scenic rock, which is an extension of the karst limestone; as well as for the vast rice paddies <br>
    that surround the beautiful limestone. Located a five-hour drive away from Kuala Lumpur, the site has about 50 climbing<br>
     routes of all grades and styles, which have been rated from 5A to 8C in difficulty levels, and vary from 12 to 30 meters <br>
     in length. There are two mountains, and most of the rock climbing in Malaysia here takes place only on the western side of <br>
     the southern hill as of now.

    Panalaban rock face in Sabah in Malaysia. It starts at 3,411 meters, and its highest point is at 3,776 meters. At the same time, it is <br>
    also Asia’s first Via Ferrata and offers two different paths to travellers to choose from, both of which guarantee spectacular views. <br>
